# Welcome to MyPage!

MyPage includes a functionality where the user can select different movies (which were hard coded) and render an article on their MyPage

Once they select a movie, and read through the article, users can like or dislike the article, and then provide feedback (made optional so users can skip giving feedback) and press the submit button!

Movies with data (please test these ones):

- 12 Angry Men
- 2001: A Space Odyssey
- Alien
- All About Eve

Have fun!
